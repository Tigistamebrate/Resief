The name of our website is Reseif.

The link to the hosted databse:
file:///C:/Users/14844/OneDrive/Documents/05-14-Presentedproject/index.html

How to deploy:
At first, I installed CLI in my computer using the documents posted on Firebase. Then I created a new folder where I initialized Firebase by running the “Firebase init” on command prompt. The features that I chose to have when initializing Firebase are Hosting, Emulators, Functions, and Database.

Once the folder was initialized, a public folder was created by Firebase where I placed all our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files along with any pictures that we had on the website. Then, I ran the “Firebase deploy” command on command prompt, on the folder containing the public folder. After the website was deployed, we were given a link to our hosted website.
